ELK is a stack composed of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elastic-stack) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) that provides at-a-glance insights into the Style Guide and enables you to drill down into details.

## Installation

### Requirements

For now the stack and scripts are tested only on Linux and Mac OS.

You need to install: 
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- curl
- bash

For Mac OS, you have to update your `/etc/hosts` and add the following lines:
```bash
127.0.0.1 elastic.docker.localhost
127.0.0.1 kibana.docker.localhost
```

### 1. Start the EK Stack

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

The first time it will take time to download docker images, have a beer.
The stack is up when you see some output like:

```bash
elastic          | {"type": "server", "timestamp": "2019-11-08T09:06:08,264Z", "level": "INFO", "component": "o.e.c.r.a.AllocationService", "cluster.name": "docker-cluster", "node.name": "elastic", "message": "Cluster health status changed from [YELLOW] to [GREEN] (reason: [shards started [[.kibana_1][0]]]).", "cluster.uuid": "76sBrZV1SXuR6CyjlGsFZQ", "node.id": "DK5p_IskRhuPpoWUmfm9Qg"  }
...
kibana           | {"type":"log","@timestamp":"2019-11-08T09:06:08Z","tags":["info","http","server","Kibana"],"pid":7,"message":"http server running at http://0:5601"
```

### 2. Import the BJCP Style Guide and Kibana Dashboard

When the stack is started, run the `install.sh` script: 

```bash
./install.sh
```
You should have:
```bash
...
### Elasticsearch index bjcp provisionned successfully
### Importing BJCP Kibana dashboard
### Success, visit: http://kibana.docker.localhost
```
      
## Usage

Once the installation is done you have access to the `bjcp` Dashboard:
- http://kibana.docker.localhost/app/kibana#/dashboards

### Searching and filtering

You can enter search query in KQL ([Kibana Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.4/kuery-query.html)).

Here are some examples:
- Search for exact style identifier
  - ```style_id: X```
  - ```style_id: 7```
- Search for style ranges
  - ```style_num <= 27```
  - ```style_num > 10 and style_num: 27```
  - ```not style: 2```
- Fulltext search on style name
  - ```style.fulltext: (porter OR stout OR brown)```
- Search for subcategories:
  - ```id: 7B```
  - ```id: 22A```
- Fulltext search on `subcategory`:
  - ```subcategory.fulltext: lager```
- Fulltext search on `aroma`, `appearance`, `flavor`, `mouthfeel` or `overall_impression` fields:
  - ```flavor: burnt```
  - ```aroma: resinous```
- Fulltext search on all fields:
  - ```Ch'Ti```


You can use sliders to filter SRM, IBU, OG, FG or ABV range.

You can filter using any selectable cloud tags.

The ["Unusual terms"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html) aggregations show interesting or unusual occurrences of terms in the beer result set.

Theses terms can be characteristics or **not appropriate** characteristics for the result set,
you need to read carefully the guideline to understand the context.

### Stop and restart the stack

You need to run the `docker-compose` command from the directory
The docker compose stack can be stop:
```bash
docker-compose down --volume
```

And restart:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The Dashboard is persisted on the `./data` directory so you can customize the dashboard.

### Advanced search

Warning: this is very experimental, do not try to get any conclusion at this stage. 

Using Elasticsearch 7.4 (non oss version :/) it is possible to use `dense_vector` field type and express vital statistic as a vector.

The vital characteristics can be normalized to be in a 0-1 range using the following ranges:

|  | 0 | 1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| IBU | 0 | 120 |   
| SRM | 2 | 40 |   
| OG | 6.5 | 30.1 |   
| FG | -0.5 | 10 |   
| ABV | 1.9 | 11.1 |   

For instance SRM=2 is translated into 0 and SRM 40 into 1.

Taking the statistics for `26D Belgian Dark Strong Ale` we have
- `ibu.avg`: 27.5
- `srm.avg`: 17
- `og.avg`: 22
- `fg.avg`: 4.3
- `abv.avg`: 7.9

Which can be rewrite to a normalized vector:
`[0.22916666666666666,0.39473684210526316,0.6567796610169491,0.45714285714285713,0.6521739130434783]`


Then we can use the `l2norm` function to calculate L2 distance (Euclidean distance) between the given vector and document vectors.
using this as ranking score returns the beers with similar vital characteristics: 
```
curl -s -X POST 'elastic.docker.localhost/bjcp/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{
  "query": {
    "script_score": {
      "query": {
        "exists": {
          "field": "vector"
        }
      },
      "script": {
        "source": "1 / (1 + l2norm(params.query_vector, doc[\u0027vector\u0027]))",
        "params": {
          "query_vector": [0.22916666666666666,0.39473684210526316,0.6567796610169491,0.45714285714285713,0.6521739130434783]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "size": 5,
  "_source": {
    "includes": [
      "_id",
      "vector",
      "vital_avg",
      "subcategory"
    ],
    "excludes": []
  }
}'
```
The results is something like this:

| subcategory | Vital average |
|  --- | --- |
| 26D Belgian Dark Strong Ale | SRM: 17.0, IBU: 27.5, OG: 22.0, FG: 4.3, ABV: 7.9, BU:GU: 0.3|
| 09A Doppelbock | SRM: 15.5, IBU: 21.0, OG: 21.9, FG: 5.1, ABV: 6.8, BU:GU: 0.23|
| 27A9 Sahti | SRM: 13.0, IBU: 11.0, OG: 23.1, FG: 4.6, ABV: 7.1, BU:GU: 0.11 |
| 10C Weizenbock | SRM: 15.5, IBU: 22.5, OG: 18.6, FG: 4.7, ABV: 6.2, BU:GU: 0.29|
| 22D Wheatwine| SRM: 11.5, IBU: 45.0, OG: 23.6, FG: 5.8, ABV: 7.9, BU:GU: 0.45|
 
 Which can be represented like this (Min and Max are ranges for the 26D subcategory):

## Dev

### About the data

The 2015 BJCP Style Guide has been turned into a JSON version along with the following metadata:

- `origin`: as described in [Styles Sorted Using Country of Origin](https://dev.bjcp.org/beer-styles/4-styles-sorted-using-country-of-origin/)
- `family`: as described in [Styles Sorted Using Style Family](https://dev.bjcp.org/beer-styles/3-styles-sorted-using-style-family/)
- `family_history`: as described in [Styles Sorted Using History](https://dev.bjcp.org/beer-styles/5-styles-sorted-using-history/) 


The original and terminal extract are in Plato instead of SG. 


For now only the subcategories are injected into Elasticsearch, some fields are added:

- vital statistics averages: `abv.avg`, `og.avg`, `fg.avg`, `ibu.avg`, `srm.avg`
- the BU:GU ratio: `bugu` which is IBU divided by the OG exprimed in gravity unit (for instance OG: 10Â°P = 1.040 SG = 40 GU) 
- subcategory names are prefixed with identifier formatted in sortable way (i.e `1A` is rewritten as `01A`)
- vital statistics are also stored as a normalized (value between 0 and 1) vector [srm, ibu, og, fg, abv] to help to find similarities
 
### Extract data from JSON to Elasticsearch bulk format

Run the python script to generate the `bjcp-es.json` file: 
```bash    
./extract.py > ./bjcp-es.json
```

Note that if you want the gravity in SG instead of Plato you can edit the `extract.py` file and set:
```python
USE_SG = True
```

### Export/import the Kibana dashboard

Use the following scripts to export or import your Kibana dashboard:

```bash
./export-dashboard.sh
./import-dashboard.sh
```
